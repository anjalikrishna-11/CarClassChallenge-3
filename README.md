# CarClassChallenge-3
My name is Anjali Krishna, a sophomore enrolled in the ISM3232 class. My U-number is U35346496. This coding challenge entails a project implementing a Car class in JavaScript to manage the speed of two cars with a functionality to accelerate and brake. Each car starts at an initial speed, then accelerates and brakes to reach different speeds. All speed changes are recorded.
