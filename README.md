# CarClassChallenge-3
My name is Anjali Krishna, a sophomore enrolled in the ISM3232 class. My U-number is U35346496. This coding challenge entails a project implementing a Car class in JavaScript to manage a car's speed with functionality to accelerate and brake, starting with initial speed, and then displaying the changes.
